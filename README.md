# Biography

**Ruiyang DAI** is a post-doc at the [Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/) of [Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/) under the supervision of [Bruno Despres](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/despres/).

He was a PhD student at [UCLouvain](https://uclouvain.be/en/index.html) in Belgium under the supervision of [Jean-Francois Remacle](https://www.hextreme.eu/staff-members/913/) and [Christophe Geuzaine](https://people.montefiore.uliege.be/geuzaine/), and a member in the [HEXTREME](https://www.hextreme.eu/) team. 

He defended his thesis on 17th Novembre 2021. Here is [his thesis' introduction](https://www.fsa.uliege.be/cms/c_7439141/fr/generalized-sweeping-preconditioners-for-domain-decomposition-methods-applied-to-helmholtz-problems) and his [manuscript](https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/260200).

Currently, he is working on models form plasmas physics, 
and his research interests lie in the broad area of kinetic equations. 
His main topic of study is the numerical methods of systems of partial differential equations that describe plasmas, such as the magnetized Vlasov-Poisson system.

Before he studied numerical methods for Helmholtz problems.
